# Gitbook Theme For Typora
This typora theme is inspired by the [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) document style. It features three variants: The standard `Azure` variant, the darker `Slate` one as well as a brand new `Teal` look.

> This theme has been developed and tested for Windows 10 (both Classic and Unibody style). It has not been tested on macOS nor Linux. However, the core theme should work.
## Installation instructions
