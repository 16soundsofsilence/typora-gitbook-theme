# Gitbook Theme For Typora
This typora theme is inspired by the [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) document style. Nearly all user interfaces have been redesigned. It contains both a light and a dark theme. For best experience turn on `Preference Panel > Appearance > Unibody`.

## Installation instructions
1. Download the zipped project package.
2. Copy the `gitbook-light.css` file and `gitbook-dark.css` file as well as the folder `gitbook` to your Typora theme library.
3. Launch or restart Typora and choose Gitbook Light or Gitbook Dark from the theme menu.
